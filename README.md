# dallESpeckleMap

## About

This is a collaborative Speckle 2024: BeyondVerse Hackathon project submission. 

## Problem Statement

The original idea sprung off from Jordana Rosa, our teammate with her current workflows at Perkins+Wills. The problem statement is described as follows:

*"AI-powered BIM with Material Feedback Loop for Revit. Currently, We're using Stable Diffusion to generate stunning AI renders from various sources such as sketches, 3D models, and photos. However, these amazing images don't currently translate back into BIM data â€“ materials, lighting, humanization elements, and so on. Here's where Speckle comes in: My idea is to leverage Speckle to bridge this gap. -Extract materials from AI-generated images: Imagine isolating "glass" or "wood" from the AI output. -Push this material data back to the BIM model: This creates a seamless workflow, saving time and improving collaboration. This two-way communication between AI and BIM offers exciting possibilities: -Faster material selection: Quickly populate models with materials suggested by AI renders. -Enhanced design exploration: Test various material combinations directly in the BIM environment. -Improved coordination: Eliminate inconsistencies between AI renders and BIM models. Looking for Teammates: Ideally, you'll have expertise in: -Speckle: A deep understanding of Speckle's functionalities and APIs. -BIM app development: Experience with BIM software and data exchange between platforms. -AI/Machine Learning: Knowledge of image recognition/material extraction techniques."*
